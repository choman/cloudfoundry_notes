# Cloud Foundry

## Abstract

## CF CLI installation
NOTE: This info was obtained from [github.com/cloudfoundry/cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)

For all platforms, 64-bit packages can be found 
[here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#installers-and-compressed-binaries)

#### NG Windows Desktop
If you are on a NG desktop, you more than likely require the binaries zip file.
It contains a standalone binary that you should be able to run from your desktop

#### Linux Recommentation
If you are on a Linux desktop, it is recommended to install the package provider 
so that your cf-cli is always up-to-date.  Instructions can be found
